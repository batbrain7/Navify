We are sure the answer is yes!
```

___
Indoor navigation has been a matter of intensive research in the past years, the problem being inability to achieve accurate positioning inside indoor arena. Some technologies that are being used for indoor navigation include **GPS, Beacons and WiFi access points triangulation** but these technologies are **inefficient** and unable to solve the problem of positioning and navigation in indoors as the **GPS has an accuracy of more than 10 metres** (in indoors less than 1m is required), beacons tend to show false position due to environmental factors such as metal presence and require high calibration time and hassle of frequent battery replacement is huge. Wi-Fi method require large number of access points which is unlikely in relatively smaller areas.
